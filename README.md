### Objective 
The objective of this project is to perform temperature conversion in different units i.e Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin in C++.

### Key Activities
- ** The algorithm to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.
- ** Use of functions and Switch case.

### Tecnologies Used
- **C++ Programming**: It is an object-oriented programming language.
- **Functions Calling**: some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together to make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call this function.
- **Switch Case**: Switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
